This repository contains a simulation program of a Viterbi Decoder, a powerful algorithm for decoding convolutional codes used in error correction for digital communication systems. The Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of hidden states (symbols) that results in the observed sequence, making it essential in applications like wireless communication, satellite links, and error-prone transmission channels.

In addition to the simulation code, this repository includes an audio sample I recorded to demonstrate the practical application of the Viterbi Decoder. The audio signal is encoded, transmitted, and decoded using the Viterbi algorithm to illustrate how it can recover transmitted data with minimal errors, even in noisy environments.

The repository provides all necessary scripts and data to run the simulation. You can easily modify the code or use your own data for experimentation.

Feel free to explore and contribute!
