This repository contains a simulation program of a Viterbi Decoder, a powerful algorithm for decoding convolutional codes used in error correction for digital communication systems. The Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of hidden states (symbols) that results in the observed sequence, making it essential in applications like wireless communication, satellite links, and error-prone transmission channels.

The repository provides all necessary scripts and data to run the simulation. You can easily modify the code or use your own data for experimentation.

Feel free to explore and contribute!
